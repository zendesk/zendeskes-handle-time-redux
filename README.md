===============

### Overview
A modified version of the Time Tracking app which allows for:

- tracking of time for multiple groups
- which uses a modal to request time on ticket submission if required
- allows for removal of incorrectly logged time by the person who logged that time or an admin
- stores historical data as JSON in a custom ticket field and total group times in individual numeric fields
